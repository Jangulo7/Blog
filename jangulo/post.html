                        <h3>Artificial Intelligence, October 16, 2020</h3>

                        <p>According to <cite class="reference"><a href="https://www.womenintech.co.uk/the-future-is-female-opportunities-for-women-in-ai">Woman in Tech (WIT) UK</a></cite>, much like the technology industry overall, there is a gender gap in AI for women. Recent data suggests that as few as 26% of the AI industry being made up of women.</p>
                        <p>WIT pointed out that combining the gender gap with the growing jobs market in AI, <q cite="https://www.womenintech.co.uk/the-future-is-female-opportunities-for-women-in-ai">you get a window of opportunity for women looking to start a career in tech or change pathways in their already established tech careers.</q> </p>
                        <p>To fulfil the growing demand for more Artificial Intelligence professionals, the talent pool must be increased to include candidates from a variety of genders, cultures, backgrounds, ages and ethnicities.</p>
                        <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
                        <p>AI is not only transforming the way we live and communicate, but it’s changing the way almost every industry around the world operates. However, it has been well documented that AI suffers from a gender bias problem, and the products and services being created are displaying inherently gender bias properties. It’s for this reason that there’s so much opportunity and a necessity for women to work in AI because to solve the gender bias problem current AI products are displaying, the teams of people creating them need to be reflective of the truth that humankind is characterised by diversity.</p>
                        <h2>How to pursue a career in AI</h2>
                        <p>Encouraging <em>girls from a young age to study the essential subjects such as Maths and Science</em>, that open doors for opportunities to go on to pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence, is going to be key to increasing the number of women in the sector in future. However, for women already working in tech who decide they’d like to change to a career in AI, it’s more a case of understanding where they can access the training, networking and resources they need.</p>
                        <p>Narrowing the gender gap in Technology is vital for so many reasons, the most pressing being establishing and sustaining genuine equality and access to opportunity regardless of gender. For AI it’s perhaps even more vital that the future is gender diverse and more and more women are represented in the sector because this technology continues to have an increasing amount of responsibility and influence over daily life. It will be damaging if it reinforces gender bias and inequality rather than becoming a powerful tool in working with us to progress gender equality in Tech and wider society.</p>
